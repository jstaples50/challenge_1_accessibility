# Challenge_1_accessibility

## Description

This project was designed to simmulate an on-the-job ticket or feature request. The main focus of the ticket was to make the starter code more accessible, but several other sub-objectives were achieved as well. Some issues that were resolved were:

- CSS code consolidated and commented
- HTML code tags changed to be more semantically correct
- Alt text added to images to make them more accessible
